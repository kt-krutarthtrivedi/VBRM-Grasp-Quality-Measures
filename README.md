# Vision Based Robotic Manipulation : Grasp-Quality-Measures

The aim is to analyze various grasp quality measures as explaind in 
[“Grasp quality measures: review and performance” by Maximo A. Roa and Raul Suarez](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-014-9402-3)

## Problem Statement:

![problem](https://github.com/kt-krutarthtrivedi/VBRM-Grasp-Quality-Measures/blob/main/media/Problem%20Statement.png)

Using the grasp quality measures explained in the paper above, we try to find the best way of applying 5th force vector to make the grasp more stable and reliable.

## Methodology:

Please find the algorithm explanation in the [Report.](https://github.com/kt-krutarthtrivedi/VBRM-Grasp-Quality-Measures/blob/main/media/Report.pdf)
